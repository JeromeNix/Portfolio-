        <p> Well I tried streaming on Twitch for a couple of days and ended up doing awful with the controls of Street Fighter V, It felt really awkward and sluggish but I kept playing since it was actually pretty fun. Until the game decided to not let me log into the server after the update; Later on I found out that it's pretty common after each update that it has bugs but I was in awe with disappointment. </p>

         <p>I started writing a story about a character I created, But I can't get into detail about whats it entails because it is something that regards to something like a rated M game. I had a few problems with motivation and still am, I wish could've done more with my time during break, its unfortunate. But I'm happy that I dreamt the idea up and put my thoughts into a google doc. </p>
