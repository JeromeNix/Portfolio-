       The Roman Colosseum would be an intresting place to visit since it has a lot of history around hundreds or even thousands of years of history and events held.

       This place witnessed one of the most devastating volcanic eruptions in history, which covered the this whole area in ash. From what I vaguely remember that there are actual bodys turned to ash.

    Venice is a scary place when looking at it from where its located, as well the size of it is impressive regarding that the city was built on a muddy foundation.
